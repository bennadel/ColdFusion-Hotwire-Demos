# ColdFusion + Basecamp Hotwire Demos

by [Ben Nadel][ben-nadel]

I had started to build a demo application using [Basecamp's Hotwire][hotwire] with ColdFusion (Lucee CFML in this case); but, I quickly realized that I bit off way more than I could chew, attempting to use a robust framework before I even understood the fundamentals of how Hotwire worked. As such, I wanted to start over and explore the Hotwire basics using focused, standalone demos in a ColdFusion context.
