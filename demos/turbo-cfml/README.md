# ColdFusion + Turbo CFML

This is a "hello world" to get [_my version_ of Hotwire Turbo (which is CFML compatible)][turbo-cfml] working in this demo repo.

**Note**: In order to get this to work, I had to add `git` as a dependency in the `Dockerfile`, presumably because I'm pulling `turbo-cfml` from GitHub. Also, I updated the version of `nodejs` because I think it was using an oudated version of `npm`; which was, in turn, causing some other errors.
